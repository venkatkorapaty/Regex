# Regex
CSCA48 Assignment
Evaluations regexs by telling us whether the regex is indeed a regex, builds trees for it
and checks if the inputted string matches it or not.
The regexs use the characters 0, 1, 2, e, *, . and |. For example: (1|(e.2)*) is a valid regex. (3*.(e|1)) is not as 3 is
not a valid character for this regex checker.
